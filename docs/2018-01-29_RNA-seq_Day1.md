# Learning Objectives for 1/29/18

1. To understand the Onthophagus taurus beetle biology, experimental design, and data set.
2. To understand the general work flow or "pipeline" for processing and analyzing RNAseq data.
3. To learn how to make/write a bash script and how write a script to process files in batches (*.sh files and #! should mean something to you by the end of today).
4. To visualize and interpret Illumina data quality (what is a .fastq file and what are Phred scores?).
5. To add to your growing list of bioinformatics tricks: using the `screen` command and how to test scripts with a subset of your data.
