# Learning Objectives for 1/31/18

1. To reinforce our understanding of the general work flow or "pipeline" for processing and analyzing RNAseq data.
2. To learn how data to download data from a website to a server (though you won't need to do it now).
3. To start mapping (a.k.a. aligning) each set of cleaned reads to a reference transcriptome (Program: bwa; Input: .fastq; Output: .sam).
4. To extract read count data from .sam files (i.e. the number of reads that map (align) to each "gene")
